## Player_Class
The Player class represents a player in the Magical Arena. It has attributes such as name, health, strength, and attack. Players can attack each other, and the 
game includes logic for handling damage and determining the winner.

## Arena_Class
The Arena class represents the magical arena where players engage in matches. It takes two Player objects and facilitates the progression of matches. The 
startMatch() method initiates the match and contains the game logic for player interactions.

## Dice_Class
The Dice class represents a six-sided die used for determining outcomes in the Magical Arena matches. It includes a roll() method that simulates rolling the die 
and returns the outcome as an integer between 1 and 6.

## MagicalGameRunner_Class
The MagicalGameRunner class serves as the entry point for the game. It prompts the user to enter details for two players, creates the players, initializes the 
arena, and starts the match.

## Test
The MagicalGameRunnerTest class contains JUnit tests for the application. It tests various aspects, such as arena initialization, player status, match outcomes, 
and handling of invalid inputs.
